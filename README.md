Plugins for RPG Maker MV

## List of available plugins

_SUB_BattleFormation_

The battle formation plugin enables adding a 5th member to the party. If your party has 5 members and you are usign the side-view system, you can change the actors' disposition on battle field (options: line -default-, V, X). Additionally you can allow stats to change when using X or V formation (each actor's stats will change according to its position: front-line will have increased damage but lower defense, and viceversa).

- SUB_BattleVisuals

The battle visuals allows you to change some visual aspects on the battle screen.
- 'Vertical Status': Actors' info will be vertically aligned instead of the horizontal by default.
- 'Mark Current Input': Adds a whitening effect to the current actor during the action decision phase.
- 'Show Status Command': Adds a status command, just like the one in the main menu.

(This plugin was motivated by the battle formation plugin, but is absolutely independent)
